# untitled 4 

I have been estranged from my older brother since I was 14 years old. I am now 22 so that means it has been 8 years since we have last talked to each other. We got into a pretty big fight one night and then ever since then, everything just stopped. We still live under the same roof, but we just don’t talk to each other anymore. I remember the day after the big fight I was watching TV and I had the urge to call him to watch with me, as we had always done, but I had to push myself not to. The next day I had the same urge, but a bit weaker. Then, the day after that the urge became weaker again. It kept getting weaker and weaker and before I knew it, it was all gone. My whole life I envisioned him as this perfect child, put into an elementary school for gifted kids and then advanced placement for high school. Me, I had tons of problems growing up, both medically and mentally. I watched him grow up to become a nice, functioning member of society while he watched me devolve into a mess.  Quite frankly, I want to start talking to him again, but I don’t feel like I am good enough. That is one of my problems, when people see me, I want them to think I have my shit together. I want them to view me as this strong, perfect figure, the same way I view my brother. I’ve always told myself that once I can stand on my own two feet and make him proud, I will try to talk to him again. The thing that scares me is that he truly knows who I am, he has seen me when I am weak. To have someone know who you are, from when you were a baby, to who you are now, the phases you went through, all the stupid things you’ve done, that thought terrifies me more than anything
 
I have been estranged from my little brother since I was 15 years old. I am 23 years old now so It has been 8 years since we have last talked. That kid really scared me 8 years ago. I was hiding in my room, pushing a chair against the door and he just kept kicking and kicking and kicking. The worst part about it is that my mom was outside my room but she couldn’t do anything about it, she just stood there, desperately begging. She knew she couldn’t do anything because when my brother gets mad, god can’t stop him. I tried and tried to calm him down but he wouldn’t listen. He finally calmed down when he said something so vile, so hurtful, that I just broke down on the floor and started crying. Right then, he knew he truly hurt me so he was done. He left the house and I just sat there crying, broken and angry. Angry at him and angry at my mom for not being able to do anything about it. Right after, I told my parents that I would never speak to him again, I didn’t think that would actually happen but I blinked and 8 years have already passed. One time though, a couple months after that incident, after another one of his OCD fuelled fits of rage, we were there in our car with our parents and he just felt so bad. He apologized to me profusely and I accepted. I kind of do feel bad though, for the way I used to treat him when we were kids and that he had to deal with so many problems growing up. I wish I could start talking to him again, but the thought of just doing that seems so difficult. The initial awkwardness that would come from it, the entire shift in the way things are, it just seems so uncomfortable. Do i just say “hey man, how are you?”, then what happens?. To be honest, although this is one area in my life that I would like to fix, I am also pretty content with the way things are right now.

I respect my older brother because of how humble he is, although he has every reason to brag, he always keeps his composure and acts modestly. I admire his relationship with his girlfriend, who he has been with for 6 years, and I admire  just how competent he seems to be at everything. Although, in times of anger, I find myself jealous at how he can be just so good at everything, I look up to him a lot. Sometimes I feel like he looks down on me for all the mistakes that I have made, but hell, I look down on myself for those too. I still know that he cares for me and wants the best for me. When I talk to my parents about my college and career plans, he chimes in with suggestions. When I talk to his girlfriend, she says that my brother still talks about me a lot, and when i talk to my mom, she tells me that if my brother is home and I am out, he will always ask where I went.  Although we do not communicate, I can sense that he still cares about me.

I respect my younger brother because of how caring he is. I like the way he seems to get along so well with my grandmother and I find it really cute the way he smiles at everything she says. I admire how carefree he can sometimes seem, just happy and smiling like everything is right with the world. I respect how resilient he is and, no matter how late, I admire how far he has come. I remember looking at the door to his room, a room in which, two years ago, he wouldn’t leave for months, and then comparing that to the happy, smiling version of himself today. Although she wasn't supposed to tell me this, my mom told me that my brother wants to start talking to me but he doesn’t feel like he is good enough. When I heard that, my heart just sunk. There isn’t anything I can really do about it though, he still has to grow and look past that. I feel bad that he feels that way and I wonder if I had anything to do with that, but I truly hope that once he looks past his insecurities, he will start talking to me again. 

My older brother died last night. Car accident. He was always a pretty aggressive driver, but I never thought it would be like this. I look at myself in the mirror and picture ourselves as kids. Smiling, wrestling, fighting, and arguing. I look through our old photobooks and see all of those pictures of us as kids, standing together, him always one head taller than me. I remember all the times we had together as kids, both the good and the bad, and I remember the night that it all stopped. Slowly at first, but before I knew it, it was all gone.
