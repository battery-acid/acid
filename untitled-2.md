Karmic justice, what goes around comes around, 天有眼，chickens coming home to roost, all of these fancy literature ways to essentially say that we get what we deserve. Well i’ve been a real piece of shit these past 6 months. I’ve had no motivation to do anything, I don’t know, something within me just died, I no longer leave the house, I’ve dropped out of school, I quit my job, and now I’m just at home alone in my room existing. I’ve tried setting goals for myself to try to be productive, but every movement, everything that once was so easy like working, doing something productive, hell, doing anything that would in any way, shape or form get me out of this rut seems harder and harder each day. And the longer I exist in this state, the worse it gets and it spirals out of control. That’s what i meant when I said i’ve been a real piece of shit for the past 6 months and now karma is going to catch up to me. I hate myself. I truly hate myself, I hate how far I’ve gone down this self-fulfilling cycle of negativity and the chickens are about to come home to roost. I deserve to be punished, and I need to be punished in order to achieve karmic justice. Before I get better, I need to pay my dues for being such a lazy piece of shit. Equilibrium must be restored within the universe before I can totally free myself from this mess. Once i do that, everything will get better, I’ll be able to get up at a normal time like any other person, go to school like other people my age, do my homework like the good student i’m supposed to be, and totally be happy with myself. But first, I must make myself even with the universe. I recall for these past six months how much I’ve let myself down, every time I made some goal, however small, that i’ve failed to achieve and I keep a tally in my head. Tomorrow, I will pay my dues and finally be free. The next morning when nobody was home, I opened my drawer, i push aside my clothes and pull out a stack of razor blades. I take the parchment paper off the blade, wipe off the dried blood and stand in my bathtub. I need 20 cuts to make myself even with the world. The blade reaches my thigh, I slice my skin, a single drop of blood streams down my leg. 19 more to go. Right next to the open wound, I cut again, the razor cuts through my skin smoothly, another drop of blood streams down my leg. 18 more to go. The 2 existing wounds are split open, I can see a whitish pink color inside, I attempt to push the edges of the wound together, they will not close. I slice and I slice and I slice, single drops of blood run down my leg. Dried trails of blood run down my thighs to my calves like a trail of raindrops down a car window. 10 more to go and I begin feeling dizzy, I grab the wall, my body goes cold I stand there. I had to pay my dues and I am about to pass out. What happens when my parents come home and find me passed out in the bathtub like this? I can’t continue, I just need 10 more before I am even with the universe. But I can’t continue anymore. Because of this failure, I add 2 more cuts for being a little bitch. 12 cuts to pay my debts. I turn on the water to clean off the blood, the water hits my open wounds and stings me, touching my raw nerves from straight inside. I return to my bed, close the door, and stare at the ceiling, disappointed in myself. The next day, the bed sheets are stained with blood, my boxers peel off the wounds, the wounds are still open. The open wounds are not a big deal, as they eventually close themselves off, but as I  sit there and stare at the white-ish, pinkish membrane that the wounds expose, I get the urge to just feel around there. I have never seen cuts this deep. My thighs are sliced open, resembling a paper fan that split between wound and skin and wound and skin. I still have 12 more to go. I do the same thing again, leaving me now 4 left, plus 2 as an interest payment to the universe. I pay off my debt the next day and I lay in bed that night, looking at blotches of blood on my bed sheet, my blanket sticks to my wounds and as I peel them off, strands of cotton stick within the crevices. My legs have a striped pattern between skin and pinkish membrane. I am now fully paid off and the universe is in equilibrium once again and now I have the wounds to prove it.  Everything now will be juuuusssstttt fine. I have finally accomplished something I set my mind to, I’ve actually done something difficult for the first time in six months. I had a project, I made a dedication to complete said project, and I finished it. The feeling of accomplishment now sinks over my body. But now what do I do? Do i just go back to school? Do I start waking up earlier? I feel high, like I can do anything but am still haunted by my lack of direction in life. An object in equilibrium stays in equilibrium unless acted upon by some external force. I am now at a zero balance with the universe but the only way to achieve something you really want to achieve is through hard work. In a way, you work hard now and enjoy happiness in the future. Things you do that are difficult today, will be paid off more than in full in the future. I grab the razor and head to the bathtub once again. I slice my skin and a single drop of blood runs down my leg like before. I slice and I slice and I slice until I can’t anymore. I invest into my future happiness by enduring pain in the present. The thought of future happiness excites me, I keep slicing. Everything on my bed is stained with dried blood, my parents take notice, they see the serrations on my skin. They see what I have done to myself and they break down and start crying. I am equal parts shocked and offended. “Why are you sad?, don’t you see what I’m doing? I am investing in my future!” I say with a grin. They stare at me shocked, crying. They don’t understand how I feel, I try explaining to them that every wound is an achievement, they are not hearing me out on this. I am sure they mean the best for me and I sure they want me to be happy, but they are now officially hindering my growth as a human being. I truly love my parents and I don’t want to see them like this. My parents deviate between looking me in the eyes and looking at the wounds on my leg, and everytime they look down, I see more and more tears begin welling up in their eyes. It haunts me. They just instinctually cannot understand my reasoning. For once in my life I finally feel like I am doing something productive and now they try to put a stop to it. I can empathize with their feelings, seeing their own baby desecrating his own flesh like this surely you can invest in your future in much healthier ways than this. But this pure, carnal, instinct is the epitome of hard work. Your body on a physiological level wants you to stop, and you push through the pain and through this pain, gives you a net balance against the universe. I’ve always been told that pain would only make you stronger, so doing this to myself would surely at least help me build character. However, I can’t stand seeing my parents like this. I tell them that I will see a doctor and they instantly seem relieved. They book an appointment for 3pm tomorrow. At this point, I have a 27 hour window. For the rest of the day, my parents are watchful of me, however once they fall asleep, later than usual I might add, I have 10 hours remaining. I grab a new, fresh razor and I walk into the bathtub. My thigh is a smooth field with hills of scar tissue and crevices of raw skin. 10 hours is all I have left and I fully intend on making the most of this time. I close the door behind me and get to work.
