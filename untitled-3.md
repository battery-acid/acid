# untitled 3 

I truly and wholeheartedly believe that the song silhouette by japanese artist Kana-Boon is the most brilliant song of our time. I also believe that this song, used as the theme song for the Japanese anime Naruto, popular among young teens and preteens, is one of the most symbolically brilliant things that any show director could have ever done. First off, for those not well versed in musical theory, The song is played in a D major. Now the key signature of a song is also known as the metaphorical “home” of the song, the starting point, the point where any deviations in melody will return to at some point. Now if we pay attention to the ending sentence of the first paragraph “Nanimo nanimo mada shiranu”, Nanimo means “nothing” in japanese, and it is played in a 6-5-1 chord progression. This simply means that the first, second, and third syllables of Nanimo are played 6 and 5 keys away from the D major key, and then onto the D major chord in the last syllable (1 just means on the original key of the song). Now notice how this 6-5-1 is like a child stepping out, far away from home, going 6 steps away from home, then five, then returning back home to one. Now the most interesting part about this is we don’t know in what specific context this “Nanimo, Nanimo” phrase is in, we don’t know the lyrical significance of these two words. Until, “mada shiranu”. Now Shiranu pretty much means “Dont know” or “to not know”. So in context the whole phrase is “We don’t know nothing” or “We still don’t know a thing”. Now in the “Shiranu” word is played in a 7-1-2-1 chord progression,  but you might think 7 is really far away, well in this case it's not, it's actually really close. Think about it like 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-1, with your house at the beginning and end, kind of like a globe. Now to get to 6, you can go very far, or just go the other direction very quickly. Well in this case the chord reached 7 by just going backwards, not deviating very far from its original home. Same with the 2. So when the artist is putting everything into context, it stays very close to home. Now again this is similar to our child, who learns initial lessons and values from school (6-5-1) far away from home, but then everything is put back into context very close to home (7-1-2-1). Recall that the word Shiranu puts the initial Nanimo, Nanimo (nothing, nothing) into context by making it in the context of knowledge (shiranu means to not know). So initially, you get the statement of nothing, nothing with no context, played very far away from home, then everything gets put into the context of knowledge back very close to home. Now in the context of the child, this means that he acquires knowledge at school (far away from home), but gets his underlying values, ie. Context in which to use that knowledge, close to home, AKA his family. Now, this song is about growing up. Notice in the fourth passage they have the lyrics “Tokei no hari wa hibi wa tomaranai “, which literally translates into “The hands on the clock… these days… can’t be stopped”. Again this follows our close to home and far from home contextualizing theme. With “hari wa hibi wa”, being played in the 6-5-1 chord progression twice. Hari wa - meaning needle, and hibi-wa meaning everyday. Now we know these are referring to a clock, as “Tokei” means clock in japanese, but what about the clock and its needles, what's this all about? Now again, everything is put into context far away from home (7-1-2-1) with the word “tomaranai” which means to stop. So now everything is put into context. Time can’t stop, we will all grow older essentially. Now as our child grows, he ages and becomes more mature, growing with time. He is taught basic mathematical concepts like addition and subtraction in school, all very precise, concrete stuff. That is what Hari wa (needle) refers to, to the imparting of precise, mathematical concepts onto our child at a young age. With something as precise as a needle to represent the precise science of mathematics.  Now what is the purpose of doing this, obviously it is to allow him to use these in his everyday life as simply a tool and nothing more. As he solves math problems throughout grade school, he is simply taught to apply the tools that he has learned and nothing more. That is what Hibi wa (everyday) represents in the song. Now notice how the word tomaranai (stop) puts everything into context in the 7-1-2-1 chord progression, real close to home. This tomaranai word turns the concept of the needle (Hari-wa) and the everyday (hibi wa) into deep, metaphysical  realities. Again, this is parents instilling values into our child close to home. With tomaranai, the child is taught to apply what he has learned in school from a mathematical application to a philosophical application. The child uses the concepts of addition and subtraction to reflect on his time spent in life, on death, on growing and maturing. He learns to value the concept of time and relish what little he has of it into this world. What the child doesn’t know however, is how the spark of wonder that he has will eventually die out and be turned into wisdom instead. Every time I hear this song I am haunted by the fact that my sense of childhood wonder has been erased and is now turned into drab wisdom. The child is taught how to reflect on the metaphysical, but not aware of how a part of him will die as he grows older. This is part of the genius of why the placement of this song into Naruto shippuden is such a powerful move symbolically. The song later has the lyrics  “boetenai koto mo takusan attadarou” which translates into “Getting further, further, further away…”, referring to the spark of childhood that dies out. Now going further into this song they touch upon the same themes of growing up, maturing, and etc etc. Now the reason why the placement of these messages into the naruto shippuden children's show is so brilliant is because the entire maturing and growing part of the child is mapped out right in front of them in this unassuming cartoon that they watch every saturday afternoon. The childs’ futures are all told in front of them, but the very wonder that keeps them children is what prevents them from truly grasping the deeper meanings behind this song even when it is blatantly in front of them. The childs’ sense of wonder is what draws him to the catchy melody, or fancy visuals within the theme song of the show, but true wisdom, only found in adulthood, is what draws one to analyze the deeper meaning within the placement and words and chord progressions of the theme song. The entire song is symbolic of how children gain concepts, how those concepts are turned into values, and how what makes them children will eventually die out. And it is only when said spark dies out is when they can truly realize the message that was in front of them all along.
