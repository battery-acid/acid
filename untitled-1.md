# untitled 1


As I entered the room I didn’t expect much, but the moment I entered it hit me just like that. As I looked across the room, I kind of was just overwhelmed. And then I noticed it. The entire layout, the furniture, the way i used to stack my trophies on top of one another and that's when it hit me. I just slowly paced across the room, equal parts nostalgia and fear. Then, out of the closet I noticed something, it was my girlfriend. At first I thought it was super sweet, but then it hit me, how did she know what my room looked like when I was a kid. I just stared at her smiling, holding a fake grin, but as it hit me my mind just went blank. “Is everything ok?” she asked. I was taken aback, speechless. Then I just finally asked her “how did you know?”. She said I looked through your old photos when we went to visit your mother. Remember, you were stuck in traffic and she just showed me pictures of you. You were so cute!. Ok…. i stumbled with my words. But how did you know???. I mean surely you can’t know the layout of an entire room down to the exact furniture even down to my mannerisms when it comes to organizing my paraphernelia?. What the fuck man? She just smiled and said “Thats because i love you so much that I know every single part of you.” Bruh what the fuck is wrong with her? This is freaking me out. I don’t know she never seemed like the clingy type when we first met, in fact thats what drew me to her at first you know? Having to chase something. This all struck me as a little odd. I asked her “honey, are you feeling alright?”, “”I’m feeling fine babe why?”. “Oh umm what the fuck happened to you? Why are you acting like this?” “acting like what she asked?”, “ I don’t know just acting weird, you don’t seem like yourself lately”. “Oh… ok….” she seemed a little hurt by my comment so i just decided to leave it at that. I waited for a couple days just to see what would happen, but her personality still kept on being this strange, almost creepy, upbeat and bubbly and I would be lying if I said i didn’t actually like it. To be fair, her almost nonchalant demeanor is what attracted me to her in the first place, but once the chase is over and you are finally in a relationship, that nonchalance can often be interpreted as cold and uncaring. As terrible as this might sound, I actually like this version of her more than her old self but I was still worried about her well being, so being the totally kind hearted and caring boyfriend that I was did some real vigorous medical grade research on webMD. Split personality, I’m not smart enough anyway to understand all this medicala shit, but how do i get her tested without her knowing?. Well I actually brought her to my family doctor after around 15 minutes of mental gymnastics and clever wordplay, but she agreed to get checked up. The doctor said there was not enough history to diagnose her and that an appointment with a psychiatrist would take several months. So i guess I’m stuck with her now. I mean its great, i like feeling loved you know? But in the back of my head, its just this little mosquito type effect that keeps gnawing at me. Now when I got home from work the other day, strangely enough all of the affection stopped. All the hugs when I walked in and random kisses on the cheek stopped and again I was met with her usual nonchalance. She seemed angry, like something has been eating inside her for the longest time and I probably have a real good idea of what that is about. “Do you like her?” she asked. “Like who?” I replied. “You know. HER”. I was taken aback and to be honest I didn’t really know what to say at this point. She’s only 5’2 so i wasn’t really scared for my life or anything but this was starting to freak me out. “What do you mean HER?” I asked. “You know.” she replied coldly. “You seem to be enjoying yourself alot more with HER, be honest am I wrong?” I didn’t know what to say so I just sheepishly answered  “I mean, it is kind of nice to have all that affection”. “Well you clearly like HER more than you like me!” she replied. Honestly, I didn’t know what to say, I’d be lying if that wasn’t the truth to be honest. So i replied “well you know.. Ummm…. You can be a little cold at times”. This whole situation never struck me as weird as hell until she left the house having to “cool down”. Thats when it hit me how fucking weird this whole situation is. First i find an exact replica of my room in some escape room, I guess i never questioned that further because I was to charmed by her bubbly personality, but to have my girlfriend make an exact replica of my room, to having her change personalities on a dime and then change back, that was real fucking weird. Quite frankly, I didn’t know what to believe, this whole situation was so disorientating, and not just in a dizziness type of sense but in a metaphysical sense where your whole sense of reality just comes into question. Now I sit here, writing this alone on the couch where we used to spend our days just lazing around. I sit here, nervous, sweating, tired. It's been 4 days since she left and as I analyze this whole situation over and over again I get increasingly unhinged. I feel paranoid, quite frankly I am afraid to turn off the lights. What the fuck is going on. Please I am not suicidal and If I die please please please please please. I think and I think and I think and I think and the situation gets weirder and weirder. The days and nights blend together, The blinds are drawn, my circadian rythm is shot, The chain on my door is set closed, I triple checked to make sure the windows were closed, I sit here alone in my room. Please come home, wait don’t come home, my mind is racing, do I want her to come home, what happens if she does, will she kill me, why would she want to kill me though? OHH YA THATS WHY. I micro analyze all of our past interactions that I’ve had with this new, bubbly, stupid, demented, insane, psychopathic version of her. Did I really make it that apparent that I liked that version of her more? How did I come across? Could she really tell how much I truly enjoyed the other version of her more and if so, by what magnitude. If she thought I didn’t enjoy it ttthhhhaaaaattt much more, would she really wish any will-ill on me? How did i come across. I can’t stop, my mind is racing, I want to sleep but I don’t want to, the idea of vulnerability haunts me but this fatigue haunts me more. All i can do now is wait. I wait and i wait and i wait and i wait. I hear the sound of keys outside, the rotation of the lock pistons, the door opens, blocked by the chain i put up. “Honey? Honey? Please the door chain is still on the door, Honey? Honeeeeeyyyy???”. I emerge from my den, my knees wobble and crack as I stand up, My muscles instantly cramp up, I ever so slowly limp towards the door. The ray of light coming from the door blinds me, I see her, smiling. “Why did you put the chain up dear? You never do that”. “Um. ummm. Ummmm…. Ittss because ummmm. Ummmmm. Bebe ccause i wanted to see if it worked”. She stares at me blankly. I slowly move the pin out of the harness, she sees me. Me, in all my glory, drenched in i don’t know how many days of paranoia. She takes a quick glance and then just walks in like nothing happens. “I bought those groceries that you asked for, I remembered shallots instead of white onions!”. My mind is blank, i look in the  mirrorr, she doesn’t acknowledge my grown out facial hair, my frizzled hair, my dark circles, my pale skin. She just waltzes in like she just didn’t fucking to that to me. She just leaves, leaving me as clueless as ever, to marinate in my own fear and then she just waltzes in here like nothing happened? My confusion boils to anger and then my anger boils into fury, I scream “WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?”,she looks visible confused, I pick up a bottle on the shelf, I raise it, but then I regain the little modicum of composure that I managed to retain throughout these dark, dark days and I throw it against the wall right behind her. I storm out of the kitchen in anger and I stare at myself in the washroom mirror. My chest is heaving, my jaw is clenched, I punch the wall, I rip out the toilet paper, I throw the neatly ornate soap that she just soooo happens to llove for god know why?. In my fit of rage, I settle down. Then it dawns on me. She just waltzes in here like nothing happens. Who is she? Is she really her? Or is she HER?. Which one is it? I can’t tell. All those days of paranoia suddenly come creeping in. I can feel it, I can recall the sensation, it cames back all of a sudden and now I return back into my mental den of paranoia. I slowly leave the kitchen. I sheepishly mumble “y.yyyy y y y o u have to  tootot ototo leeaveee.”. “Haha what? Why?”. “You hha ve t tt o to leave n n ow” please.. Just go” she smiles like its a joke, holding her smile, holding her smile and then stares at me, it dawns  on her. Her smile turns into a blank stare.” “ plea s e just leave. A nd don ‘t co me back”. “Babe, why, babe are you okay?”. I burst “GET THE FUCK OUT”, tears well up inside her eyes, she grabs her purse and scurries away. I lock the door behind her, pull the chain back into the position and i sprint back up to my room. I go back into my corner and i curl up, in the exact same position i was for these last however many days. I rock and I rock and the paranoia comes back, the hyperanalyzing comes back, everything comes back. I become unhinged, my unkempt facial hair slowly turns into a beard, my frizzly hair sticks out on all sides and hangs over my ears, my eye bags become increasingly deeper and I sit there and I rock. I rock and I rock and I rock. The days go by and i deteriorate, my skin is pale, my wrists turn frail, my ribs protrude, and I just sit there and I rock and I rock and I ro.
